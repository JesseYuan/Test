# Test

* A list item.
With multiple paragraphs.

* Another item in the list.


This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title").

![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Title")


I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.

If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

<blockquote>
<p>For example.</p>
</blockquote>
